#### My first project using angular. It’s very simple nothing fancy just to get a grasp of the main concepts
I created to practice the following:  
1.	Event binding 
2.	Data binding and two-way binding 
3.	String interpolation 
4.	Adding bootstrap to angular 
5.	Components and when to not use them 
6.	For loops to create a more dynamic DOM
